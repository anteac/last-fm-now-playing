This package contains a class to determine the current track a specified user is playing according to last.fm

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/last-fm-now-playing
```

## Usage

The constructor of `Spatie\NowPlaying\NowPlaying` needs an api key you can get [from the last.fm site](http://www.last.fm/api/account/create).

``` php
$nowPlaying = Spatie\NowPlaying\NowPlaying($apiKey);

$nowPlaying->getTrackInfo($lastFmUserName);
```

If the specified user is currently playing a track you'll get backy and array with keys `artist`, `album`, `trackName`, `artwork` and `trackUrl`. The `getTrackInfo`-function will return `false` when a user is not currently playing a track.

If something goes wrong an instance of `Spatie\NowPlaying\Exceptions\BadResponse` will be thrown.
